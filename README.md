# Quantum-Key-Distribution
Developing a post-quantum cryptosystem via E91 protocol implementation.

NB: This project is inspired by a tutorial by Qiskit (which can be found here: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials/blob/master/awards/teach_me_qiskit_2018/e91_qkd/e91_quantum_key_distribution_protocol.ipynb), to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the code I used. This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Quantum Computing.
